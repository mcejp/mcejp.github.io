Although it falls short of the goals I set out in the beginning – which included releasing a playable game –, I think there are some lessons worth sharing with the world.</p>

<p>This project started essentially as a challenge: inspired by the impressive work of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3DSage/videos">3DSage</a>, I wanted to see if I could build a raycasting “2.5D” engine that ran well enough to play a game.</p>

</p>

<p>I explained in <a href="/2023/10/30/gba-benchmarking.html">a previous post</a> why I find the GBA a really nice platform to develop for. I have always enjoyed game programming, but pretty much from the beginning of my C++ journey I have been stuck in the <a href="https://geometrian.com/programming/tutorials/write-games-not-engines/index.php">Game Engine Trap</a>. Due to that realization, and based on experience from my other gamedev projects, it was really important to avoid getting carried away by tasks that are fun, but ultimately non-important. To that end I established some firm rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build a <em>game</em>, not a <em>game engine</em></li>
  <li>Don’t get stuck on assets. Make a quick placeholder when necessary</li>
  <li>Don’t get distracted by languages. Use straightforward C++ and, if necessary, Python to generate code. Want fancy LISP-compiled-to-bytecode AI scripting? Put it in another project.</li>
  <li>Stick to one design direction. Don’t start branching out in the middle of development.</li>
</ul>

<p>And <em>it worked</em> – until I realized that tech development is the really interesting part for me, and while it is fun to think about the final result, with all the captivating environments and assets and mechanics, actually getting there eventually turns into a chore. Therefore, after not touching the project in several months, I declare time for a post-mortem!</p>

<h3 id="what-worked-out-well">What worked out well</h3>

<p>My tech stack was fixed more-or-less from the start. The main language for run-time code was C++, technically <strong>C++20</strong>, but I use barely any new language features. I was determined to use <strong>CMake</strong>, partly because it is the native project format of my favorite C++ IDE (CLion), partly because <a href="https://ascii.mcejp.com/posts/CMake-tips-&amp;-tricks.html">I just like it</a>. As toolchain, I used devkitARM at first, but moved to the official <strong>ARM GNU Toolchain</strong> with <a href="https://www.coranac.com/man/tonclib/"><strong>Tonclib</strong></a> to access the GBA hardware. Tonclib is really great. I don’t think it gets enough praise, and I think that more libraries should follow the same kind of spartan philosophy.</p>

<p>For really hot code paths, namely sprite scaling code, I also generate what are basically unrolled loops. They’re still compiled as C++, GCC does a good job of optimizing it. I didn’t want to write any assembly code except as a last resort at the end of the project, since it would be time-consuming to maintain.</p>

<p>Most games cannot exist without a considerable amount of <strong>assets</strong>. Having previously built somewhat sophisticated asset pipelines, this time I wanted something dead simple, knowing my game <a href="https://github.com/mcejp/GBA-raycaster/blob/master/doc/content-guidelines.rst#content-system-assumptions">would be very small</a>. I had recently finally grasped how input/output dependencies work for custom steps in CMake projects, so it seemed kind of obvious to use these for asset compilation, including the management of any dependencies between assets (such as between sprites and palettes). On GBA, the entirety of the cartridge ROM shows up as addressable memory, so instead of embedding custom binary formats and filesystem images, I just decided to <strong>generate a C++ header with the compiled data</strong> for each asset. Here’s an example snippet from the animation data for a spider enemy:</p>

<p>I cannot overstate how satisfied I am with this solution. Again, this might only work for games up to a certain size. Rumor has it, though, that there is leaked Pokémon R/S/E code out there which does the exact same thing.</p>

<p>The custom asset compilers are all written in Python with only the most essential external dependencies (Numpy and <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/">Pillow</a>). Python dependency management in this context is still an unsolved problem for me; in principle, the CMake script could set up a <em>venv</em> and install arbitrary dependencies at configuration time, but such a setup sounds rather fragile. So I just require those two packages to be already installed in whatever interpreter is used to configure the project.</p>

<p>To create and edit maps I opted for the venerable <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a> editor and it didn’t disappoint. About the only point of friction was due to difference in the coordinate system between the editor and the game, so the conversion script has to include some transformation math which took a few iterations to get right:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># correct for rotation

<p>Benchmarking was an important part of the development process. I wrote about it at length in <a href="/2023/10/30/gba-benchmarking.html">a previous article</a>. Unless you are willing to spend a lot of time experimenting and guessing, I would now say that having strong benchmarking capability built-in is <strong>essential</strong> in such a project sensitive to “detail optimization” (I don’t know if there is an established term for this – what I mean is that changing e.g. the alignment of some function or structure can make a 1% performance difference, which quckly adds up. A related idea is <a href="https://youtu.be/Ca1hHC2EctY">“performance lottery”</a>, which should really be called <em>performance chaos theory</em>, whereby a minor change to the codebase can have performance impacts elsewhere by changing the layout of the compiled code).</p>

<h3 id="what-didnt-work">What didn’t work</h3>

<p>Content. Brace for an obvious statement: it is one thing to imagine a grand, Daggerfall-scale game in your head, and a completely different thing to actually start building the pieces that make it up. I am not a graphic artist and I get quickly frustrated playing one. (If you haven’t figured by now, I am writing this article as a reminder/deterrent to future me.) I could commission the graphics and sounds, but that gets expensive for a game with no prospect of commercialization. Making maps was more interesting, but I often felt like I was missing the right textures for the environments I wanted to build.</p>

<p>Controls were an issue from the beginning. I should have done more research into how other FPS games solved this. What I settled on was “tank controls” on the D-pad, A/B to strafe and R to shoot.</p>

<p>The screen on the GBA is notoriously bad. I don’t know how we managed to stare at it for hours as kids. The gamma curve is crazy, the colors are kinda washed out, and the contrast is a joke. The right answer here is probably to simply use a GBA SP, but I don’t have any emotional connection to it.</p>

<p>In any case, it always feels great to see your code run on real hardware, but after already being somewhat burned out with assets, it really drove home the latter two points above, providing a final straw to kill the project.</p>

<h3 id="just-show-me-the-code">Just show me the code</h3>

<p>The release is as complete as was possible; unfortunately, I do not have redistribution rights for the third-party assets. I have blackened them out in the published files, hopefully keeping just the silhouettes can be considered fair use.</p>

It is straightforward enough to understand thoroughly
– a single 32-bit CPU, no OS, no built-in wireless features –
but also sufficiently advanced to allow an ergonomic workflow based on modern languages and tools
like C++20 and CMake (or Rust).
Still, it is not particularly powerful in terms of raw computation and when writing rendering
code, even a simple ray-caster, some way of benchmarking the performance is essentially a must.</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="../../../images/2023/gba-benchmarking/raycaster.png" alt="Screenshot of an untextured raycaster" /></p>
</figure>

<p>It is, of course, possible to add FPS (or better, cycle) counters on the screen and
check them after every code change, but we seek a more rigorous approach.
It should be completely automatic, so that it is trivial to execute both locally and in a CI pipeline.</p>

<p>Here is the rough idea:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Implement benchmarking in the game, using hardware resources built into the GBA.
In my project I am using the TONC library which provides
<a href="https://www.coranac.com/man/tonclib/group__grpTimer.htm">rudimentary cycle counting</a> using GBA Timers 2 &amp; 3 in a cascade mode.</li>
  <li>(optional) Record a sequence of inputs to replay during the benchmark, to move around 
the scene and get more statistically relevant results.</li>
  <li>Execute a GBA emulator in headless mode (no GUI) and have it output the measured
performance metrics.</li>
  <li>Capture this output for further processing.</li>
</ol>

<p>This leaves me with 2 problems to solve: find a cycle-accurate emulator that can
run headless and somehow exfiltrate the measurements from the emulated console.</p>

<p>It turns out that the GBA’s <em>SIO</em> peripheral supports an <a href="https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#siouartmode">UART mode</a>,
which in essence means very simple character output.
Perfect, now just to find an emulator that can forward the UART to the host operating
system.</p>

<h3 id="mgba">mGBA</h3>

<p>As of writing, <a href="https://mgba.io">mGBA</a> is the only GBA emulator “confidently recommended” by the
<a href="https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Game_Boy_Advance_emulators">Emulation General Wiki</a>.
Not to imply that this is somehow the authoritative source on all things emulation,
but I have gotten good advice from it in the past.
mGBA is being actively developed and it’s <a href="https://mgba.io/2014/12/28/classic-nes/">technical blog</a> provides some
excellent reading.
Does it fit the bill, though?</p>

<p>mGBA implements <a href="https://mgba.io/docs/scripting.html">Lua scripting support</a> that allows to introspect
the emulated system rather deeply.
Unfortunately, it <a href="https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba/issues/3053">does not implement</a> UART mode.
However, there is an alternative – albeit non-standard – way to get stuff out of the
emulator.
This mechanism consists of several I/O registers in the 0x04FFxxxx address space of the
emulated system.
Through these registers, the ROM has access to the emulator’s own logging facilities.</p>

<p>mGBA comes with <a href="https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba/blob/0.10.2/opt/libgba/mgba.c">example code for using these</a>, assuming a libgba runtime.
As mentioned earlier, my project is based on TONC;
fortunately, porting the example code is trivial – in mgba.c,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">#include &lt;gba_types.h&gt;</code> just needs to be changed to <code class="highlighter-rouge">#include &lt;tonc_types.h&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Next, I was looking for a way to run mGBA headless and for a limited duration.
At first it looked like some level of source code hackery would be necessary,
but then I discovered one of the built-in test utilities, <em>mgba-rom-test</em>.
It can execute  a ROM, without any user interface, and while it cannot be told to quit
after a fixed interval of time (like <em>mgba-perf</em> can),
it can exit once the game calls an SWI specified by the user.</p>

<p>Calls a <em>what</em>? SWI (software interrupt) instructions are normally used to invoke
<a href="https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#biosfunctions">functions built into the GBA BIOS</a>;
we can therefore either re-purpose a function that would never be used during the benchmark,
or find an unallocated SWI number to claim for our purposes.
In absence of convincing reasons for either option, I went with the former, appropriating
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Stop</code> call (<code class="highlighter-rouge">swi 0x03</code>).</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-together">Putting it together</h3>

<p>A minimal, but complete example then looks like this:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <em>mgba-rom-test</em> executable is not distributed with mGBA releases, in fact, it is not even
compiled by default. We will need to build mGBA from source with some custom flags.
Since we don’t care about GUI or fancy features, we can use additional options to minimize
the build time and dependencies.
The following configuration worked well for me:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cmake -DBUILD_QT=OFF \
        -DBUILD_ROM_TEST=ON \             &lt;-- secret sauce

        -DUSE_EDITLINE=OFF \

        -DUSE_ZLIB=OFF \
        -G Ninja ..

$ ninja mgba-rom-test
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If everything goes well, we run it like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ./test/mgba-rom-test -S 0x03 --log-level 15 /path/to/ROM.gba

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">--log-level</code> is a bit field whose documentation leaves it rather mysterious, but it seems
to correspond to <a href="https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba/blob/0.10.2/include/mgba/core/log.h#L15"><code class="highlighter-rouge">enum mLogLevel</code></a> in the code base.
A value of 15, or 0x0F, then corresponds to all levels from FATAL down to INFO, but excluding
DEBUG and lower.
Without the flag, mGBA’s implementation of the GBA BIOS emits a message every time a BIOS
function is used, which can be annoying.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-scenarios">Multiple scenarios</h3>

<p>At the beginning I alluded to recording inputs for later playback.
It doesn’t seem to be implemented as a native feature of mGBA at this time, so let’s come
back to this topic in the future.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a presumably easier problem, which is how to select one out of multiple
test scenarios to execute.
There exists a trivial solution which is to use compile-time flags and build a number of
different ROMs, one per scenario.
That feels rather wasteful, and a potential nightmare to manage as the number of tests cases
goes up.
Can we, instead, bake everything into a single ROM and make the choice at runtime?</p>

<p>Having previously solve the problem of <em>extracting</em> data from mGBA, let’s now look at the ways
to <em>inject</em> data at the start.
A cursory glance reveals a number of entry vectors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the ROM file itself</li>
  <li>the built-in command-line debugger (<code class="highlighter-rouge">-d</code>)</li>
  <li>the built-in GDB (<code class="highlighter-rouge">-g</code>)</li>
  <li>IPS patches (<code class="highlighter-rouge">-p</code>)</li>
  <li>Lua scripts</li>
  <li>save states (<code class="highlighter-rouge">-t</code>)</li>
  <li>cheat codes (<code class="highlighter-rouge">-c</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these are out – for example, the scripting engine is not accessible in <code class="highlighter-rouge">mgba-rom-test</code>.
Patching a fixed address inside the ROM is always an option, but let’s look for something more
elegant.
Save states are very powerful, but they use a proprietary binary format, which might even
change between versions of the emulator.</p>

<p>What about cheat codes? They operate on the principle of hooking the game code and allowing
pretty much arbitrary memory modifications. That sounds interesting, to say the least!</p>

<p><img src="../../../images/2023/gba-benchmarking/gameshark.jpg" alt="Photo" /></p>
  <figcaption>GameShark for Game Boy Advance</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of course, things cannot be <em>too</em> simple. The cheat devices for the GBA are a mess, with the
most famous ones (Action Replay and GameShark Advance) <a href="https://wunkolo.tumblr.com/post/144418662792">encrypting their codes</a>.
While the encryption has been broken open years ago, it would be preferable to avoid such
a complication altogether.
There is <a href="https://doc.kodewerx.org/hacking_gba.html#cba">Codebreaker, where encryption is optional</a>.
Finally, mGBA supports a “VBA” cheat file format (presumably pioneered by VisualBoyAdvance),
which is the most straightforward of all: it’s just a list of address-value pairs.</p>

<p>In order to do their dirty work, the classic cheat devices work by hooking the game code
and hijacking a suitable branch instruction,
whose address is encoded as part of the cheat “master code”.
With VBA cheats, this is not necessary; the memory modifications are applied at the end of each
emulated frame.
This has the downside that the game has to wait for one frame to pass before checking the memory
location (~5 extra lines of code including clean-up).
It still seems like a better trade-off than having to look for a Thumb branch instruction that
is on the main code path and guaranteed to be stable across builds.</p>

<p>Having sorted out the mechanism, we still need a place to put our magic cookie.
For a proof of concept, let’s just put it at the very end of EWRAM, which spans the 256 KiB from
0x0200 0000 to 0x0203 FFFF.
The linker script should ideally be adjusted to make sure that the compiler will not interfere
with our chosen special location.</p>

<p>The cheat file itself then boils down to a single line:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>0203FFFE:beef
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And reading the value from inside is straightforward, too:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// wait for 1 frame to pass</span>
<span class="n">irq_init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">NULL</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">irq_enable</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">II_VBLANK</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">VBlankIntrWait</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="n">mgba_printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">MGBA_LOG_INFO</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"Requested test case: %04Xh"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">u16</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="mh">0x0203FFFE</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s see it in action:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$  ./test/mgba-rom-test -S 0x03 --cheats cheatfile.txt --log-level 15 /path/to/ROM.gba
GBA Debug: Requested test case: BEEFh

</code></pre></div></div>

</figure>

<p>We can now take it one step further, and have the benchmark run automatically in a CI pipeline.
It makes sense to separate the ROM build step from the benchmarking step,
since the former needs the GBA toolchain to build, while the latter builds mGBA for the host
platform (or whatever container image we run it in),
before executing the test proper.
The complete example is a bit too long to reproduce here in full, but you can

<p>Bare-metal 64-bit ARM programming is a strange niche: small, power-efficient microcontrollers usually implement the – considerably simpler – 32-bit version of the architecture. And on larger chips, one would typically run their application under a full-blown OS, namely Linux.
Yet, there are cases where one needs the raw performance of an advanced 64-bit CPU, but a standard OS, despite all efforts to tune it, would bring in too much timing uncertainty for real-time process control.</p>

<p>Welcome to CERN, where standard approaches don’t quite cut it, and <em>state of the art</em> is yesterday’s news. The FGC4, a new digital controller in development by the <a href="https://sy-dep-epc.web.cern.ch/">Electrical Power Converters</a> group has <a href="https://www.ipac23.org/preproc/pdf/WEPM080.pdf">exactly this kind of requirements</a>.</p>

<p>Debugging these kinds of systems can be… <em>interesting</em>. There is a whole spectrum of mechanisms that one might have at their disposal, depending on choices made in the system design – from the simplicity of the blinking LED, the versatility of a serial output, to the sophistication of a JTAG adapter.
But once the device is out in the field, you cannot guarantee to be present when an error occurs. The best you can do is to log it in the maximum detail possible, and attempt to understand the issue later.
Fortunately, there is a standard mechanism for that – the core dump. Unfortunately, it is not readily available in environments like the one described in this post.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-core-dump">What is a core dump?</h2>

<p>A core dump is a snapshot of the state of a process, usually at the time it crashed.
The idea is that you can take this snapshot, load it up in a debugger, and inspect the process as if the error had occurred just moments ago.
The most precious piece of knowledge to recover is perhaps the stack trace; however, the ability to inspect the program’s variables can certainly be useful as well.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while a core dump is the de-facto standard way of capturing process state, its format is actually dependent on the host operating system (as is the case for executables).
But on bare metal, there is no OS. No OS, no core dump – right?
Well, consider this: what if we could <em>pretend</em> to be running an OS, and synthesize the core dump file accordingly?
Then we could use all the standard tools to analyze it and extract useful information.</p>

<h3 id="anatomy-of-a-core-dump">Anatomy of a core dump</h3>

<p>Interestingly, on Linux the same ELF format used for executables and libraries is used as a container for the core dump.
They even use the same <a href="http://blog.k3170makan.com/2018/09/introduction-to-elf-format-part-ii.html">program headers</a> to describe memory segments, although things begin to diverge beyond that.
Before diving deeper into the specifics, let’s take a look at what such a dump contains:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A data structure giving basic information about the process, such as its PID or argument list</li>
  <li>A snapshot of the process’ memory, including code, global variables, thread stacks and the heap</li>
  <li>For each thread:
    <ul>
      <li>A structure giving basic information</li>
      <li>A copy of the CPU state, including general-purpose and floating-point registers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For better illustration, let’s draw a comparison between a core dump and a standard executable. An ELF executable usually includes these sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">.text</code> (executable code)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">.rodata</code> (read-only data)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">.data</code> (initialized data)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">.bss</code> (zero-initialized data); since the contents of this section are known to be all zeroes, it is not necessary to physically include them in the file</li>
</ul>

<p>When you use GDB to save a core dump, it will contain a copy of all of these, plus the program heap and stacks of all threads.</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="../../../images/2023/aarch64-coredump/executable-vs-coredump.png" alt="Screenshot" /></p>
  <figcaption>Comparison of the memory sections between executables and core dumps – both in ELF format. Note that each file contains additional sections <em>not</em> corresponding to program memory</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This has been a simplification, and to correctly synthesize a core dump, we have to be a bit more precise:
The core dump will indeed contain a snapshot of memory corresponding to the sections mentioned above,
however, this snapshot is described by one or more <code class="highlighter-rouge">PT_LOAD</code> segments rather than sections; names and other attributes of sections are therefore lost.
This is not a problem, because we can extract section information from the original executable file.</p>

<h4 id="process--thread-information">Process &amp; thread information</h4>

<p>An ELF-encoded core dump also contains a <code class="highlighter-rouge">PT_NOTE</code> segment providing some general information about the process and its threads.</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="../../../images/2023/aarch64-coredump/pt_note.png" alt="Screenshot" /></p>
  <figcaption>Structure of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">PT_NOTE</code> segment</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="inspecting-a-core-dump">Inspecting a core dump</h3>

<p>To extract useful information from a core dump, the original ELF file of the program is also required. This is because the core dump does not contain information about symbols, let alone mappings from compiled code to source locations.
With a core file in hand, we can execute</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ gdb program.elf core
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will start GDB, load the program ELF file and combine it with the information found in the core file.
This article is not meant as a GDB tutorial, but in case you need a rundown, <a href="https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~learn/debugging/modules/gdb_coredumps/">this one</a> is quite nice.
What matters to us here is the observation that information contained in the core dump is “overlaid” on top of the original executable.</p>

<h2 id="writing-our-own">Writing our own</h2>

<h3 id="impedance-mismatch">Impedance mismatch</h3>

<p>There are some discrepancies between the Linux model and a bare-metal application.
For example, there is no concept of Process ID or a command line. We also assume a single thread of execution.
That might not always be the case; one might, for example, want to capture the state of a multi-threaded FreeRTOS application.</p>

<p>Another difference is that of address spaces: Linux processes always execute in virtual memory, while a bare-metal program would use physical memory directly.
In practice, it’s not really a problem. All that matters is that the addresses agree between the ELF of the program and the dumped image. As long as we do not move the program around when loading it, this will indeed be the case.</p>

<h3 id="collecting-information">Collecting information</h3>

<p>A core dump would usually be emitted in response to a program crash. Under an operating system with memory protection, it is well-defined what a program is allowed to do. On bare metal, the possibilities are much wider and there are footguns aplenty. Without going too much into detail, one symptom of a critical problem on AArch64 can be a <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0024/a/AArch64-Exception-Handling/Synchronous-and-asynchronous-exceptions">Synchronous exception</a>. If the goal is to produce a dump, it is important to save <em>all</em> general-purpose registers (GPRs) on exception entry instead of just caller-saved ones, as is often done before calling an exception handler written in C/C++.
You can see an example <a href="https://gist.github.com/mcejp/56c26608cf90e2120cdf887ea961b851">here</a>, but it will probably require adapting to your specific application.</p>

<p>Besides the GPRs, we also need to gather the contents of floating-point registers, and finally, we need to know which region(s) of memory are relevant to the program.</p>

<h3 id="writing-the-core-file">Writing the core file</h3>

<p>With all the inputs on hand, we can move on to assembling the actual file.
ELF is not the simplest format to write manually (without the use of any libraries), but in this case the structure will be simple enough. To begin, we need a copy of <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/linux/elf.h">elf.h</a> (careful about the license, though) to provide the structures and constants.
A slight complication here lies in the fact that we have to precompute all the offsets and sizes. Let’s begin by visualizing the physical layout of the file we are going to write:</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="../../../images/2023/aarch64-coredump/physical-layout.png" alt="Screenshot" /></p>

<p>First comes the ELF file header. Not much surprising here. Note the file type of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ET_CORE</code>.</p>

<p>Next, we will need to write two program headers: one for the memory snapshot (it can, in fact, come in multiple segments, but we’re keeping things simple) and one for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">PT_NOTE</code> segment described previously.

<p>At some point it gets quite tiring to write the same code over and over, so I went ahead and made it into a little library. It’s pretty straightforward. First, you create a graph.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">goeiedag</span>

<span class="n">graph</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">goeiedag</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">CommandGraph</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Afterwards, you add tasks to it…</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">pathlib</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Path</span>

<span class="c1"># Get username
</span><span class="n">graph</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">add</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s">"whoami"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"&gt;"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"username.txt"</span><span class="p">],</span>
          <span class="n">inputs</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[],</span>
          <span class="n">outputs</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"username.txt"</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…and execute it.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">goeiedag</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">build_all</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">graph</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Path</span><span class="p">())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that if you run this code twice, it will not re-execute the <code class="highlighter-rouge">whoami</code> command, since the output already exists and is considered up-to-date.</p>

<p>For commands that have inputs (or <em>dependencies</em>), the build tool needs to know about these, so that it is able to determine when the output has become obsolete and needs to be rebuilt. Of course, one command can depend on outputs from other commands, as long as there are no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_dependency">circular dependencies</a>.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># Extract OS name from /etc/os-release
</span><span class="n">graph</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">add</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s">"grep"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"^NAME="</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"/etc/os-release"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"&gt;"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"os-name.txt"</span><span class="p">],</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To make usage more convenient and avoid repetition, the library provides some special symbols to let you refer to the declared inputs and outputs when building up the command.</p>

<p>When <code class="highlighter-rouge">graph.build_all</code> is called, the library will generate a <a href="https://ninja-build.org/">Ninja build</a> file and execute it. I didn’t feel a need to re-implement the logic of orchestrating and executing the DAG efficiently, so the aim was to take advantage of an existing build executor. Compared to Make, Ninja has more pleasant tooling, better performance when dealing with complex builds, and is also easier to generate code for (for one, it cleanly supports tasks that generate multiple outputs).</p>

<p>There exist many similar libraries with somewhat different paradigms; for example, <a href="https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/graphs.html">Dask</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/taskgraph/">TaskGraph</a> use plain Python functions, rather than shell commands, as a unit of execution. This is advantageous if your flow is Python-heavy, but it locks you out of taking advantage of high-quality build executors like Ninja. <a href="https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Snakemake</a> does work with commands, but AFAIU doesn’t help you build the task graph programatically – the input has to be provided in Snakemake’s text format.</p>

<p>The package is <a href="https://pypi.org/project/goeieDAG/">available on PyPI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mcejp/goeieDAG">GitHub</a>.

<div class="language-hy highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defmacro</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">iota</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">max</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">list</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">range</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">max</span><span class="p">))))</span><span class="w">

<p>One could argue that this is a stupid thing to do, that I should have simply defined my <code class="highlighter-rouge">print</code> as a new macro, and used the standard <code class="highlighter-rouge">hy.eval</code>. Well, what if my set of core forms <em>is not known ahead of time</em>? Consider another language, one where each core form executes a shell command of the same name:</p>

<div class="language-hy highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defmacro</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">get-filename</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">"hello.txt"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Well, with this structure, you can do that! The evaluation block just changes to this:</p>

<div class="language-hy highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="w">        </span><span class="c1">; evaluate form</span><span class="w">

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This seems quite useful, doesn’t it – imagine the possibilities! I would be curious to see the <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> equivalent, since the juggling of modules and scopes seemed quite a bit more involved there. On the other hand, Racket has first-class custom language support, which might help quite a bit. And then there is <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/ee-lib/index.html">ee-lib</a>, which I have yet to explore.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This seems like a very obvious thing to do, but I could not find a simple example anywhere.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">ARMv8: Cache coherency between code running in different exception levels</title><link href="https://mcejp.github.io/2022/08/05/cache-coherency.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ARMv8: Cache coherency between code running in different exception levels" /><published>2022-08-05T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-08-05T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://mcejp.github.io/2022/08/05/cache-coherency</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mcejp.github.io/2022/08/05/cache-coherency.html"><![CDATA[<p>At its heart, the Xilinx UltraScale+ SOC has a multi-core Cortex-A53 CPU. This is not the fastest ARM out there, but it’s still plenty capable. One interesting feature is its built-in Snoop Control Unit (SCU). This enables transparent synchronization of L1 caches among the individual cores. There is one pitfall that you might fall into when running bare-metal code: the distinction between secure and non-secure memory access.</p>

<p>If one of your cores operates in a secure exception level (such as EL3) and another runs a non-secure exception level (EL1), by default they see different memory spaces. The AXI bus has a signal called <code class="highlighter-rouge">AxPROT</code> that distinguishes secure and non-secure access. Once your data reaches a “stupid” memory such as DDR SDRAM, this distinction vanishes; however, the data cache does takes it into account and effectively treats these two as separate address spaces. Thus, your precious shared memory buffer will not be coherent until flushed on one side and invalidated on the other.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a simple solution. The page tables that you set up to configure the MMU (a prerequisite for using the snooper) <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0406/cb/System-Level-Architecture/Virtual-Memory-System-Architecture--VMSA-/Long-descriptor-translation-table-format/Memory-attributes-in-the-Long-descriptor-translation-table-format-descriptors?lang=en">have a bit called <code class="highlighter-rouge">NS</code> (Non-secure)</a>. Setting this bit forces all accesses to be treated as Non-secure even when running in a secure EL. The converse (forcing secure access from EL1) is of course not possible, because it would completely break the security model.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">NS</code> is bit 5 of the <em>Lower attributes</em>, so if you’re using the Xilinx-provided template code (<code class="highlighter-rouge">translation_table.S</code>) and you don’t really care about this type of security, you might want to simply change the line which says</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.set Memory,	0x405 | (3 &lt;&lt; 8) | (0x0)		/* normal writeback write allocate inner shared read write */
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.set Memory,	0x425 | (3 &lt;&lt; 8) | (0x0)		/* normal writeback write allocate inner shared read write (forced non-secure) */
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alternatively, this can be done at runtime.</p>

<p><img src="../../../images/2022-06-20-builds/screenshot.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>

<p>For my <a href="https://github.com/mcejp/Poly94">latest FPGA toy project</a>, I was looking for a way to have an overview of builds with performance metrics – f<sub>max</sub> and resource usage, but also results of simulation and benchmarks.</p>

<p>GitLab CI has a convenient feature whereby one can specify a regular expression to extract test coverage from CI logs, and this value is then displayed on the job list page. Unfortunately it does not offer any flexibility beyond that.</p>

<p>Despite searching far and wide, I didn’t find any satisfactory solution (at least not for free), so I set out to build my own.</p>

<p>The rough idea was the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>collect key metrics from CI jobs:
    <ul>
      <li>timing results</li>
      <li>resource usage</li>
      <li>test results under simulation</li>
      <li>benchmarks under simulation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>accumulate data across builds</li>
  <li>present in a spreadsheet for easy viewing</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="../../../images/2022-06-20-builds/diagram.png" alt="schematic" /></p>

<p>Since I am already quite invested in GitLab CI, I wanted to maximally reuse the facilities it provides. However, to accumulate data across many builds, I still needed some kind of database. I opted for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, motivated by the existence of <a href="https://supabase.com/">Supabase</a>, which provides a 500 MB cloud-hosted database for free. It doesn’t really matter, a private MariaDB or some NoSQL solution would do the job as well. The only requirement is reachability from the CI runners.</p>

<p>The next question was one of the database schema. I decided to harcode only a few very general columns which might need to be indexed later, for purposes of filtering and sorting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>commit hash &amp; title</li>
  <li>timestamps of commit + pipeline</li>
  <li>CI pipeline URL</li>
  <li>branch name</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of the build data is shoved into a JSON object to allow maximum flexibility and easy schema evolution.</p>

<p>To present the data, a final CI job generates a static, self-contained HTML page and deploys it via GitLab Pages. Simple!</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>Let’s take a walk through the code now.</p>

<h3 id="db-schema">DB schema</h3>

<p>We start by creating a table. (Recall that <code class="highlighter-rouge">public</code> is the default schema in a new PostgreSQL database.)</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="k">public</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">builds</span> <span class="p">(</span>

    <span class="n">branch</span> <span class="nb">varchar</span> <span class="k">NOT</span> <span class="k">NULL</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">commit_sha1</span> <span class="nb">varchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">40</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">NOT</span> <span class="k">NULL</span><span class="p">,</span>

    <span class="nv">"attributes"</span> <span class="n">json</span> <span class="k">NULL</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="k">CONSTRAINT</span> <span class="n">builds_pk</span> <span class="k">PRIMARY</span> <span class="k">KEY</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="configuring-the-jobs-to-always-save-artifacts">Configuring the jobs to always save artifacts</h3>

<p>Builds may succeed or fail, but in any case, we want the logs to be saved for later processing. This applies to all build and simulation jobs.</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">build_yosys</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">script</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">...</span>

  <span class="na">artifacts</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="na">paths</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">build/nextpnr-report.json</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">ulx3s.bit</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">*.log"</span>
    <span class="na">when</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">always</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that if an entry under <code class="highlighter-rouge">paths</code> fails refers to a non-existent file, GitLab Runner will complain a bit, but ultimately will go about its day, without triggering a job failure or skipping the remaining artifacts.</p>

<h3 id="collecting-the-results">Collecting the results</h3>

<p>The first custom job is tasked with collecting the results of all builds/tests, extracting key metrics, and storing them into the database.</p>

<p>For this reason, it needs to depend on all the previous jobs and their artifacts.</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">reports</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">stage</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">upload</span>

    <span class="na">artifacts</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">true</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">job</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">test_verilator</span>

    <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">./tools/ci/save_build_stats.py</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/mcejp/Poly94/-/blob/develop/tools/ci/save_build_stats.py">The body of this script is</a>, for the most part, unremarkable. We begin by preparing a dictionary and collecting the first pieces of metadata:</p>

<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">results</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
<span class="n">results</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"commit_title"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">environ</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"CI_COMMIT_TITLE"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The results extraction is mostly tool specific, so I will only reproduce one example here, which is that of parsing Cocotb results in JUnit format:</p>

<div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">exists</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"results.xml"</span><span class="p">):</span>

<h3 id="a-note-about-security">A note about security</h3>

<p>The database connection string is supplied through an environment variable, which allows us to store it in the GitLab project with reasonable security – <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#limit-the-environment-scope-of-a-cicd-variable">as long as an untrusted party cannot execute an <code class="highlighter-rouge">echo</code> command in our CI</a>. Admittedly, this is a weakness of the chosen approach. To allow secure collection of results from pipelines triggered by third parties (which includes all merge requests, for example), it would probably require a separate, trusted pipeline or some kind of scraper task running somewhere in the cloud.</p>

<h3 id="scalability">Scalability</h3>

<p>You might have noticed that there is no pagination mechanism; in fact, the presentation job has <em>O(n)</em> complexity with respect to the number of historic builds. This will not scale once there are hundreds and thousands of builds, and a more efficient approach will be required.</p>

<p>The collection and presentation jobs also add some time to the overall runtime of the pipeline. Unfortunately, it seems that most of this time is just overhead of spinning the runner up, thus quite difficult to get rid of.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughs">Final thoughs</h2>

<p>At this point, it might seem an logical next step to generalize the presented solution into something more flexible, an off-the-shelf tool that could suit other teams. For now, I have decided against that for reasons of complexity. In the world of build automation and complex FPGA designs, different projects have wildly different needs; and while a couple hard-coded scripts are easy to understand and maintain, a useful generic framework would need a lot of flexibility, thus incurring a high upfront cost in terms of complexity.</p>

<p>Therefore, my recommendation would be that you just copy the code, and adapt it to your specific needs.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KUXXo_OP_eU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>This video demonstrates, in slow motion, the process of rendering a 3D scene using so-called S-buffers. Compared to the now-ubiquitous depth buffering, this technique requires much less memory (and memory bandwidth) when rendering low resolution, low polygon count scenes.</p>

<p>The rendering consists of two steps. In the first phase, an array of empty linked lists is initialized (one list per scan line). The polygons to be displayed are then projected into screen space, clipped to the viewport, and decomposed into tuples of <span class="kdmath">$(Y, X_{start}, X_{end})$</span>. These are inserted into the linked lists, at position <span class="kdmath">$Y$</span> in the array and ordered by <span class="kdmath">$X_{start}$</span> within each list. These spans are clipped against each other, based on relative depth of end-points, to ensure no overlap within the S-buffers. (Intersecting faces are not handled well in my implementation, and will lead to visual glitches.)</p>

<p>At the end of the first phase, objects of infinite depth (such as a sky box) may used to fill gaps in the S-buffers.</p>

<p>Contrary to what the video shows, by this point, nothing would have been drawn to the screen yet.</p>

<p>Enter phase two: the viewport is scanned line by line, and the spans for each line are rasterized, in order, into the frame buffer. If any gaps remain, they are filled with a background color. Because the spans cannot overlap, the scene is drawn with zero over-draw.</p>

<p>The processing time of the first phase depends on the viewport resolution, as well as complexity of the geometry. It is beneficial to draw the closest objects first, to avoid having to replace spans already inserted. (this issue is demonstrated at the beginning of Scene #2, where many small objects are drawn, only to be completely obscured later)</p>

<p>The second phase consists mainly of pushing pixels, so viewport resolution will be a driving factor. In addition, there is a non-trivial cost per span drawn, because properties of the original face must be fetched to set up texture coordinates or any other interpolated attibutes.</p>

<p>Transparent surfaces must be drawn at the very end, back-to-front, with depth-based clipping against spans in the S-buffers. This makes them rather inefficient and prone to over-draw.</p>

<p>You might notice that occasionaly there are pixel gaps between adjacent faces. This is not due to any fault of the algorithm or the renderer implementation, but due to <a href="https://wiki.ldraw.org/wiki/T-Junction">T-junctions</a> in my geometry, which must be fixed in the source data, or by face splitting as a preprocessing step.</p>

<p>The video was made possible, in part, by the <a href="https://github.com/higan-emu/libco">libco</a> library, which allowed me to insert yield statements deep in the renderer loops without much hassle.
