The [CS4954](../../../images/cs4954/CS4954-55_F6-39674.pdf) is a long-obsolete NTSC/PAL Digital Video Encoder by Cirrus Logic. Despite being out of production, it is a nice chip, and is being used on the [CLONE BUINO DUAL](https://hackaday.io/project/123606-clone-buino-dual) to drive the composite video output.

<!-- TODO: show schematic -->

## Hello world?

To get video output on the composite (CVBS) port with minimum effort, these are the steps to take:

- Apply power to the chip
- Provide 27MHz reference clock
- Via I<sub>2</sub>C, change the following control flags (preserve the defaults for other flags and other registers):
    - **CONTROL_0**: Set _MSTR=1_ (Master Mode)
    - **CONTROL_4**: Set _COMDAC_PD=0_ (composite DAC: power up)
    - **CONTROL_5**: Set _EN_COM=1, LOW_IMP=1_ (enable composite DAC, enable composite output)
    - **CONTROL_3**: Set _CBAR=1_ (enable internal color bar generator)
- Note that the default output format is NTSC-M ITU-R.BT601. If this is not what you want, you can consult Table 4 of the datasheet which describes register configuration for other formats.

Tip: you might want to make use of [cs4954.h](https://github.com/mcejp/cs4954/blob/master/cs4954.h).

That should be enough to get you the familiar color bars:

Another thing to try is to set _CBAR=0_ and then varying the _BKG_COLOR_ register. You should get a screen filled with a solid color that changes accordingly. The _BKG_COLOR_ register is encoded as a 3:3:2-bit RGB value, no need to worry about any YC<sub>b</sub>C<sub>r</sub> bullshit.

Thanks to Master Mode, we don't have to worry about providing any synchronization signals -- everything is taken care of internally.

## Next steps

Color bars are a nice start, but what if we want to display our own picture? For this, we need to first gain understanding of the input format(s) understood by the video encoder. In fact, with the CS4954, we have 2 choices of input encoding:

### ITU R.BT601 ([spec](https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bt/R-REC-BT.601-7-201103-I!!PDF-E.pdf))

In this mode, the inputs go in as 8-bit words in the pattern C<sub>b</sub>--Y<sub>1</sub>--C<sub>r</sub>--Y<sub>2</sub>. This pattern repeats 360 times during the visible part of a scanline, yielding 720 pixels of luminance resolution and 360 pixels of chrominance resolution. This is also known as [4:2:2 chroma subsampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling#4:2:2).

Conversion between the RGB and YC<sub>b</sub>C<sub>r</sub> color spaces is conceptually simple, but requires matrix multiplication, which is not a problem on PC, but can be tricky or expensive in embedded systems. The coefficients can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr#ITU-R_BT.601_conversion). Note the "interesting" ranges of values: 16--235 for Y, 16-240 for C<sub>b</sub> and C<sub>r</sub>. Legend says that these have something to do with analog representation of the signals and under/overshoot concerns.

The CS4954 gives us a choice of a Master or a Slave mode. In Master mode, the chip generates HSYNC & VSYNC signals and provides them as digital outputs; conversely, to use Slave Mode, HSYNC and VSYNC must be fed to the video encoder along with pixel data.

#### Timing

In NTSC (interlaced) mode, a _frame_ consists of 2 _fields_. You get 29.97 frames, so 59.94 fields per second. One frame consists of:

      3   blank lines      (  1..  3)
      3   VSYNC lines      (  4..  6)
     15   blank lines      (  7.. 21)
    240   picture lines    ( 22..261)
      4.5 blank lines      (262, 263, 264, 265 + 1st half of 266)
      3   VSYNC lines      (middle of 266 .. middle of 269)
     15.5 blank lines      (2nd half of 269 + 270..284)
    240   picture lines    (285..524)
      1   blank line       (525)

The numbers in brackets are 1-based and inclusive.

As for horizontal timing:

     128 HSYNC cycles    (   1.. 128)
     116 blank cycles    ( 129.. 244)
    1440 pixel cycles    ( 245..1684) encoding 720 horizontal pixels
      32 blank cycles    (1685..1716)

A quick verification: 1716 * 525 * (30 / 1.001) = 27,000,000 cycles per second, which is exactly the reference frequency used by the CS4954.

### ITU R.BT656 ([spec](https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bt/R-REC-BT.656-4-199802-S!!PDF-E.pdf))

The BT656 spec is freely available, but I found the wording just a little bit ambiguous. On the other hand, the application note from Intersil ([mirrored here](../../../images/cs4954/8625.itu656.pdf)) is crystal clear and presents data in a format useful for encode implementation.

BT656 encodes pixel data in the same way BT601, but it also embeds synchronization in the data stream instead of requiring additional discrete signals. The vertical timing becomes much simpler, with no silly half-lines:

     21 blank lines      (  1.. 21)
    240 picture lines    ( 22..261)
     23 blank lines      (262..284)
    240 picture lines    (285..524)
      1 blank line       (525)

As for horizontal timing:

       4 EAV cycles      [FF, 00, 00, XY]
     268 dummy cycles    [80, 10, ...]
       4 SAV cycles      [FF, 00, 00, XY]
    1440 pixel cycles    [Cb, Y1, Cr, Y2]

yielding the same grand total of 1716 cycles/line.

The XY word is a bit more involved: from MSB to LSB its 8 bits read as `1FVHPPPP`. Fortunately, we can pretty much ignore the meaning of the individual bits, thanks to this handy decoding table:

Line number, 1-based | F | V | H (EAV) | H (SAV)
--------------------:|--:|--:|--------:|--------:
    1-3|1|1|1|0
   4-20|0|1|1|0
 21-263|0|0|1|0
264-265|0|1|1|0
266-282|1|1|1|0
283-525|1|0|1|0

- F=0 for lines 4 thru 265, F=1 for lines 266 thru 525 and 1 thru 3
- V=1 for lines 1 thru 19 and 264 thru 282, V=0 otherwise
- H=0 for SAV, H=1 for EAV
- PPPP provides 4-bit parity which ~~allows correction of any single-bit error~~ no one seems to care about, at least for inter-IC applications. Again, you can find more details in the Intersil application note.

Since BT656 mode needs 2 pins fewer than BT601, it seems like the obvious way forward.

## Open questions

1. Is there a drop-in replacement chip with better availability?
